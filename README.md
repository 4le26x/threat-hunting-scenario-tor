![Network Topology](Images/TOR%20Usage.png)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged

- **Windows 10 Virtual Machines** (Microsoft Azure)  
- **EDR Platform:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint  
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**  
- **Tor Browser**  

## Scenario
Management suspects that certain employees may be using the TOR browser to bypass network security controls. Recent network logs reveal unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, anonymous reports indicate that employees have discussed accessing restricted websites during work hours.

The objective of this investigation is to detect any TOR usage, analyze related security incidents, and mitigate associated risks. If TOR usage is confirmed, management will be notified immediately.

## Indicators of Compromise (IoC) Detection Plan
- Analyze **DeviceFileEvents** for any references to `tor.exe` or `firefox.exe` indicating TOR installation or usage.
- Monitor **DeviceProcessEvents** for execution traces of TOR-related files.
- Inspect **DeviceNetworkEvents** for outgoing connections on well-known TOR network ports.

## Steps Taken

## 1. File Event Analysis
A query was executed on the **DeviceFileEvents** table to identify suspicious file activities related to TOR. The investigation found that the user account `employee` downloaded a TOR installer, leading to multiple TOR-related files being copied to the desktop. Additionally, a text file named `tor-shopping-list.txt` was created on the desktop, suggesting possible premeditated TOR usage.

**Timestamp of suspicious activity:** `2025-02-16T20:19:26.4762431Z`

#### Query Used:
```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "aph-treat-lab"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "employee"
| where FileName contains "tor"
| where Timestamp >= datetime(2025-02-16T20:19:26.4762431Z)
| order by Timestamp desc 
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

## 2. Process Execution Analysis
The **DeviceProcessEvents** table was examined to determine whether the TOR browser was installed or executed. It was discovered that, at `2025-02-16T20:19:24.9266039Z`, the user executed a newly downloaded file named `tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.6.exe` from the Downloads folder. The execution used the `/S` parameter, which indicates a **silent installation**.

#### Query Used:
```kusto
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "aph-treat-lab"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine, SHA256
```

## 3. TOR Browser Execution Analysis

Searched for any indication that the user **"employee"** actually opened the TOR browser.Evidence confirms that **tor.exe** was executed at `2025-02-16T20:26:35.0890959Z`. Multiple instances of **firefox.exe (TOR)** and **tor.exe** were spawned afterwards, indicating **active TOR usage**.

### Query used to locate events:
```kusto
DeviceProcessEvents  
| where DeviceName == "aph-treat-lab"  
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe", "tor-browser.exe")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine, SHA256
| order by Timestamp desc
```

## 4. Network Connection Analysis
The **DeviceNetworkEvents** table was analyzed for evidence of **TOR network connections**. At `2025-02-16T20:21:01.2992025Z`, an employee **initiated a network connection** via `firefox.exe` from the **TOR Browser directory**, connecting to `127.0.0.1` on port `9150`, which is **commonly used by TOR for anonymized traffic routing**. 

Additionally, **connections to external sites over port 443 were detected**, indicating potential access to restricted websites.

### Query Used:
```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "aph-treat-lab" 
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9050", "9051", "9150", "9040") // Common Tor ports
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, 
RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath
| order by Timestamp desc
```
